## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- JS

### What I learned

At first I thought this will be easy one, but I stucked and spend a lot of time on positioning of the elements in the features section. Anyway, at least it was good practice. In JS I wrote almost two times shorter code for mobile menu than before, so I am happy about that :) If anyone have sugestions, please feel free to let me know. Thank you.
